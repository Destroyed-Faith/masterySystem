/**
 * Picks -> Level Progression compiler.
 *
 * The three Level 1/2/3 progression picks are the single source of truth for an
 * artifact's 1-10 Level Progression table. Each pick (a catalog Power or a Stone
 * Function) is expanded into three staged rows:
 *
 *   Pick L1 -> artifact levels 1 / 4 / 7   (stage I / II / III, PL 4 / 10 / 16)
 *   Pick L2 -> artifact levels 2 / 5 / 8
 *   Pick L3 -> artifact levels 3 / 6 / 9
 *
 * Power picks pull the real per-stage text (range / aoe / duration / effect /
 * special) from the catalog template's PL 4 / 10 / 16 rows, so the change at each
 * stage (radius, damage, special) is visible. There is no Level 10 row.
